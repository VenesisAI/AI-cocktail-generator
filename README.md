# AI Cocktail Generator



## Summary

This project explores the exciting potential of using AI to create new and unique cocktail recipes. By analyzing a dataset of existing cocktail recipes, the AI will generate innovative combinations for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, offering inspiration to mixologists and enthusiasts worldwide.

## Background

The world of cocktails is dynamic, with experts estimating there are between 10,000 and 20,000 different cocktail recipes in existence. Yet, there is endless potential for new creations. This project aims to harness AI's capabilities to expand the cocktail repertoire by:

* Suggesting novel combinations of ingredients.
* Ensuring compatibility of flavors.
* Encouraging experimentation in mixology.
* Exploring unconventional, unique, and exotic flavor combinations.
* Personalizing recipes based on user preferences.
* Highlighting trends or seasonal ingredients.

The motivation for this project comes from the creative nature of mixology and the desire to inspire professionals and hobbyists alike. By generating ideas that might not naturally occur to a human mixologist, the AI can push the boundaries of cocktail innovation.

## How is it used?

This AI-powered tool will work as follows:

1. Input existing cocktail recipes and their ingredients into the system.
2. Use AI algorithms to analyze patterns, ingredient compatibility, and flavor profiles.
3. Generate new cocktail suggestions, categorized into alcoholic and non-alcoholic options.
4. Provide users with detailed recipes, including ingredient proportions and preparation methods.

Possible use cases:
* Professional mixologists looking for inspiration.
* Cocktail enthusiasts experimenting at home.
* Bars and restaurants seeking unique menu offerings.

## Data sources and AI methods

The project will utilize:

* Existing publicly available cocktail recipe datasets.
* Ingredient flavor profile databases to evaluate compatibility.
* AI methods such as:
  - Generative models for creating new combinations.
  - Recommendation algorithms to tailor suggestions to user preferences.

Potential data sources:
- [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)
- Ingredient pairing databases.

## Challenges

While the AI can suggest innovative cocktails, there are limitations:

* Flavor pairing relies on available data; unique local ingredients may not be included.
* Ethical considerations include promoting responsible alcohol consumption.
* Certain combinations may still need human taste-testing for validation.

## What next?

The project can grow by:

* Incorporating user feedback loops to refine recipes.
* Adding features like pairing cocktails with meals or occasions.
* Expanding to non-cocktail beverages, such as smoothies or mocktails.

Looking for collaborators with skills in:
- Data analysis and preprocessing.
- AI/ML model development.
- UI/UX design for the toolâ€™s interface.
